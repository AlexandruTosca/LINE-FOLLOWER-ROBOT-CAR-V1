The car was programmed to cross a route consisting of three destinations, in the order given by the user: ABC, ACB or CBA.

The communication between the machine and the user will be done through an IR remote control.

After the calibration has been performed and a route has been selected, the car will cross that route, following the line, and if it encounters an obstacle on its way (at a distance less than or equal to 10 cm), it will stop and sound an acoustic signal and visually the presence of this obstacle, until the route is freed, after which it will continue on its way to the FINISH line.
